# how-to-restrict-the-automatic-submission-of-suggestion-in-SfChat
This repository contains a sample demonstrating how to restrict the automatic submission of suggestion in .NET MAUI Chat SfChat.

## Sample

```xaml 

        <sfchat:SfChat x:Name="sfChat"
                       Messages="{Binding Messages}"
                       CurrentUser="{Binding CurrentUser}">
            <sfchat:SfChat.Behaviors>
                <local:SfChatSuggestionItemSelectedBehavior />
            </sfchat:SfChat.Behaviors>
        </sfchat:SfChat>

Behavior:

    public class SfChatSuggestionItemSelectedBehavior : Behavior<SfChat>
    {
        protected override void OnAttachedTo(SfChat bindable)
        {
            base.OnAttachedTo(bindable);
            bindable.SuggestionItemSelected += OnSuggestionItemSelected;
        }

        protected override void OnDetachingFrom(SfChat bindable)
        {
            base.OnDetachingFrom(bindable);
            bindable.SuggestionItemSelected -= OnSuggestionItemSelected;
        }

        private void OnSuggestionItemSelected(object? sender, SuggestionItemSelectedEventArgs e)
        {
            e.CancelSendMessage = true;
        }
    }

```
